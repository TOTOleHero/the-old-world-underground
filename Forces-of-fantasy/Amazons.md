## Amazons special rules


**Blades of the ancients** : The Amazons carry a special kind of weapon of unknown origin, wich they call the Blades of the Ancients. These weapons are rumoured to be rare and mush sought after High Age artefacts. Despite their vast age they are still powerful, the gems set within them said blaze with the captures fires of a falling star.

The blades give the amazons +1 Strength in close combat. Furthermore, they projects a shield or arcane energy around the wearer, granting her a 6+ Ward save.

In addition the Amazons can point the baldes at the enemy and unleash the very flames of the sun itself in the shooting phase. This grants each Amazon a missile attack with a range of 12'' wich causes a Strength 3 hit, No penalities from range  or movement apply whene the amazons use this attack.

**skirmishers** : Amazons are well accustomed to jungle warfare and as such they are regarded as skirmishers. Should they required to rank un in order to fight in a melee. (Anakonda, Humming Bird,and Pirrana must be positioned in the front of rank)

**Native of Lustria** : The Amazons are native of Lustria and jungle hold no peril for them. When using the jungle rules (like WFB6 Warhamer Realms: Lustria ) they are immune to the same Encounters as the Lizardmen.
